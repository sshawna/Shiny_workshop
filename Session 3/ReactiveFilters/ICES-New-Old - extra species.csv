closely related species. White anglerfish occur throughout the north-east Atlantic
and in the Mediterranean and Black sea. They are most abundant at depths of 200-
800m but also occur in coastal waters. Black anglerfish are more restricted in their
range: they do not occur as far north and are mainly found offshore between 200 and
500m depth. Juvenile white anglerfish are mainly found offshore; medium-sized fish
migrate inshore and the adults move offshore again. Juvenile black anglerfish are
mainly found in the western Celtic Sea and sometimes in the Bay Biscay.
Anglerfish are difficult to age but they appear to be relatively fast-growing. White
anglerfish grow around 15cm per year and black anglerfish around 12cm per year.
Females grow larger than males and mature at larger sizes.
The population structure is poorly understood but genetic diversity within the species appears to be limited.

maximum age of boarfish is about 30. Spawning occurs on the Celtic Sea shelf edge
during June and July. Under optimal conditions, boarfish are capable of spawning over
an extended period of time. Maturation occurs at 3.5 years, corresponding to a total
length of approximately 10 cm. The maximum size of this species is about 18 cm.

in the northern Atlantic. They occur mostly at bottom depths between 10 and 200m.
Haddock are moderately large gadoids with a diet consisting largely of benthic molluscs,
crustaceans, worms and small fish. Small haddock are important prey for saithe and large
cod.
The waters around Ireland provide important spawning and nursery areas for haddock.
Irish waters are at the southerly end of the distribution of haddock, allowing them to
grow fast and mature early. They reach a length of around 27cm after two years of
growth and most haddock are mature at age two. However, haddock are a coldadapted
species and warm winters have been linked to poor recruitment success.
All haddock stocks occasionally produce extremely large numbers of recruits, which can increase the stock size
dramatically.","On average approximately 3,642 tonnes of haddock were caught and landed in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels between 2015 and 2017, 31% of which were caught in 7.g.

and 370m depth. Adult hake mainly feed on fish and squid and can occur close to
the bottom as well as off the bottom. Hake are relatively fast growing (around 15cm
per year in the first few years of life). Males mature around 35cm and females
around 50cm. The spawning period is long and occurs mostly in the first 6 months
of the year.
There is no evidence for the existence of multiple populations of hake in the northeast
Atlantic, so from a biological point of view this is considered to be a single
stock.","On average approximately 3,234 tonnes of hake were landed annually by Irish vessels between 2015 and 2017, most of which were caught in 7.g and 7.j.

northern Atlantic. Saithe live in shoals and occur close to the bottom, in midwater and even near the surface.
Juveniles occur mostly in coastal waters while older fish move to deeper waters. Tagging experiments have
shown that adults can migrate over considerable distances, indicating at least some exchange between the
Norwegian coast, Faroe and Iceland. Survey data show that density in the north eastern North Sea is markedly
higher during summer than during winter, suggesting dispersal during the feeding season.
Saithe feed primarily on pelagic organisms. Krill is the most important food for young fish, but is also consumed
by larger individuals. Larger fish mainly feed on capelin, sandeels and other fish species.
Growth is quite rapid and the saithe reach sexual maturity at the age of 5 or 6 years.","On average approximately 820 tonnes of saithe annualy were landed in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels between 2015 and 2017. 42% of which were caught in 7.g and 28% caught in 7.j.

sai-7,pok.27.7,Saithe,Subarea 7 (West Of Ireland And Celtic Sea)    ,126441,Pollachius virens,POK,Saithe,Demersal,"Saithe is a large Gadoid, reaching maximum size of 130cm. It is a cold-water species distributed throughout the
northern Atlantic. Saithe live in shoals and occur close to the bottom, in midwater and even near the surface.
Juveniles occur mostly in coastal waters while older fish move to deeper waters. Tagging experiments have
shown that adults can migrate over considerable distances, indicating at least some exchange between the
Norwegian coast, Faroe and Iceland. Survey data show that density in the north eastern North Sea is markedly
higher during summer than during winter, suggesting dispersal during the feeding season.
Saithe feed primarily on pelagic organisms. Krill is the most important food for young fish, but is also consumed
by larger individuals. Larger fish mainly feed on capelin, sandeels and other fish species.
Growth is quite rapid and the saithe reach sexual maturity at the age of 5 or 6 years.","On average approximately 820 tonnes of saithe annualy were landed in mixed demersal fisheries by Irish vessels between 2015 and 2017. 42% of which were caught in 7.g and 28% caught in 7.j.

Pollack are fast growing at 10cm or more per year. The maximum reported size is 130cm in length and 18.1kg in
weight. The maximum reported age is 15 years.

around 60cm in length. Spawning occurs mainly in the first half of the year, at about 100 m depth. Pollack can

This makes these stocks more vulnerable to overexploitation. Given that the harvest rate for 2017 has increased, ICES state that the separate catch limit for FU 16 should remain in place.

Therefore FEAS advises that the TAC in 2016 should be no more than 18,911 t. 

In 2014 ICCAT carried out an updated assessment. In 2015 ICCAT examined new biological and catch information. While evaluations all continue to show that there has been a recent increase in SSB, the magnitude and rate of the increase remain highly uncertain.  

In 2014 ICCAT agreed a 20% annual increase in TAC from 2015- 2017.

A new assessment will take place in 2016.   


Ireland has no target fisheries and by-catches in pelagic fisheries are subject to an unallocated bycatch quota for EU vessels (32.97 t in 2015). This by-catch allowance may be very restrictive as the stock rebuilds. FEAS advises that when the stock can be shown to have rebuilt with at least 60% probability, the rebuilding measures should be replaced with a long term management strategy. Such a strategy should contain adequate provision for unavoidable by-catch in non-target fisheries.

This stock has been subject to the landing obligation since 1 January 2015. There is no proposed quota uplift as ICCAT considers discards to be negligible.

A rebuilding plan has been in place for this stock since 2006.
